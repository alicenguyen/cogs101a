Lecture 3 - Measurement & Psychophysics 
================================================

Terms: 
---------------------------------------------------
* **absolute threshold** - the minimum stimulus intensity that can just be detected.  
	- (i.e. For seeing a light, the threshold would be the intensity at which
	  the light can just barely be seen)  

* **difference threshold** - smallest difference between two stimuli that can be
  detected.  

* **psychophysical methods** - methods used to measure the relationship between
  stimuli and perception. 

* **methods of limits** - the experimenter presents stimuli in either ascending
  order (intensity is increased) or descending order ( intensity is descreated)
  which indicates the results of n experiment that measures a person's threshold
  for hearing a tone.  

* **sensory modality** -  

 
 
	

What type of psychophysical measurements do we use?  
---------------------------------------------------
Qualitative Methods:  
* **Description (phenomenological method)**  
	- Provides a general physical description of the stimulus.  
* **Recognition**:  
	- Name the stimulus or identify what category it belongs to. 
	
Quantitative Methods:  
---------------------------------------------------
1. Detection  
	* **absolute threshold** - smallest amount of stimlulus energy required for
	  detection. 
	  	1. **Method of limits**
			* Stimului are presented at different intensities. The order switches at
			each trial. The observer indicates whether they detect the signal. When
			the answer changes, this is called a **crossover point**.  
			* absolute threshold = mean value(crossover points) 
		2. **Method of adjustment** 
			* Observer adjusts stimulus intensity until they detect the stimulus  
			* trials can be repeated to get an average stimulus intensity value require for detection  
			* advantage: fast  
		3. **Method of constant stimuli**
			* Experimenter presents 5-9 stimuli with different intensities in random order. 
			* Each stimuli is presented several times, but in random order.  
			* threshold = the intensity at which the stimulus was detected 50% of the time.  
			* advantage: most accurate method.  





	* **difference threshold** - smallest difference between two stimuli that
	  can be detected  
2. Magnitude estimation  
3. Visual search and reaction time
