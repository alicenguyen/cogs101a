Lecture 3 & 4 - Measurement & Psychophysics 
================================================

Terms: 
---------------------------------------------------
* **absolute threshold** - the minimum stimulus intensity that can just be detected.  
	- (i.e. For seeing a light, the threshold would be the intensity at which
	  the light can just barely be seen)  

* **difference threshold** - smallest difference between two stimuli that can be
  detected.  

* **psychophysical methods** - methods used to measure the relationship between
  stimuli and perception. 

* **methods of limits** - the experimenter presents stimuli in either ascending
  order (intensity is increased) or descending order ( intensity is descreated)
  which indicates the results of n experiment that measures a person's threshold
  for hearing a tone.  

* **sensory modality** -  

 
 
	

What type of psychophysical measurements do we use?  
---------------------------------------------------
Qualitative Methods:  
* **Description (phenomenological method)**  
	- Provides a general physical description of the stimulus.  
* **Recognition**:  
	- Name the stimulus or identify what category it belongs to. 
	
Quantitative Methods:  
---------------------------------------------------
1. Detection  
	* **absolute threshold** - smallest amount of stimlulus energy required for
	  detection. 
	  	1. **Method of limits**
			* Stimului are presented at different intensities. The order switches at
			each trial. The observer indicates whether they detect the signal. When
			the answer changes, this is called a **crossover point**.  
			* absolute threshold = mean value(crossover points) 
		2. **Method of adjustment** 
			* Observer adjusts stimulus intensity until they detect the stimulus  
			* trials can be repeated to get an average stimulus intensity value require for detection  
			* advantage: faster because observers can determine their threshold
			  in just a few tirals by adjusting the intensity themselves  
		3. **Method of constant stimuli**
			* Experimenter presents 5-9 stimuli with different intensities in random order. 
			* Each stimuli is presented several times, but in random order.  
			* threshold = the intensity at which the stimulus was detected 50% of the time.  
			* advantage: most accurate method because it involves many
			  observations and stimuli are presented in random order, which
			  minimizes how presentation on one trial can affect the observer's
			  judgement of the stimulus being presented on the next trial.   
			* disadvantage: is time consuming  

		4. **Adaptive staircase methods**
			* Stimuli are presented in a dynamic fashion to best fit the current test subject.  
			* Rather than always testing an etire range, the stimuli automatically converge on the crossover points.  
			* You take the average of **all the reversals** - points where you change your response - to determine a threshold 
			* advantage: most stimulus intensity levels are placed around average.  
			* disadvantage: 
				- difficulty with steps that are too small (takes
			  	forever) or too large (low precision).  
			  	- can't estimate leves other than the average  
				- subject can't anticipate the stimuli and adjust response
				  accordingly.  

	* **difference threshold** - smallest difference between two stimuli that
	  can be detected called the **JND (just noticeable difference)**  or **DL
	  (differenze limen)**
	  	* observer is presented with 2 stimuli: a "standard" and a comparison
		  stimulus. the standard remains at th teh same value, but the
		  comparison can vary along some dimenstion (e.g. weight, sound
		  intensity, light intensity, etc.)

2. Magnitude estimation  
	* **Steven's Power Law** => P = KS^n
	*  **response expansion** -  if ( n > 1), then  the perceived magnitude increases faster ethan stimulus intensity.
	*  **response compression** - if (n < 1), then it describes the magnitude increasing more slowly
	   than stimulus intensity.  

3. Visual search and reaction time  
	* helps characterize the regularities between physical stimuli and
	  psychological states. 

iClicker Questions
---------------------------------------------------
1. You want to do a quick screen of people in your experiment to make sure their 
hearing is within the normal range for a 1000 Hz tone.  You only need to determine if 
their absolute threshold is above a certain level. What is the most efficient
threshold method to use?  
	a. method of limits  
	b. **method of adjustment**  
	c. method of constant stimuli  
	d. adaptive staircase   
	
	How would you re-write the questiong for the adpative staircase method to be
	the correct answer?
