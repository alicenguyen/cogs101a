Lecture 2 - Levels of Analysis and Explanation
================================================
The study and measurement of perception:    
-----------------------------------------
1. The perceptual process  
2. Defining measurement of perception  
3. Parsing perception:
	- the **empirical** (reductionist) approach and Marr's levels of analysis  
4. Qualitative approaces to measurement:  
	- Description and recognition  
5. Quantitative approaches to measurement:  
	- Detection and magnitude estimation  
	
#### 1) Perception as an active process:  
Environmental stimulus  
* light hits the tree and is then reflected from the tree to the
  person's eyes.  
* sensory apparatus orients towards a **distal stimulus** in the environment  
* the tree is the distal stimulus.  
		  
#### 2) Light is reflected and transformed:  
* light reaches the eye and is transformed as it is focused by the eye's
  optical system --> **cornea**  
* The sensory signal from the **distal stimulus** is transmitted and transformed to become a pattern 
* the **proximal stimulus** - on the sensory organ.  
* ***stimuli and responses created by stimuli are transformed, or
  changed, between the environment stimulus and perception***  
* form a sharp image of the tree on the ***receptors*** of the person's
  retina.    
* ***Principle of representation*** - "everything a person percieves is
  based not on direct contact with stimuli but on represesntation of
  stimuli that are fomed on the recepters and on activity in the
  person's nervous system.  
* the light reflected from the tree is the proximal stimulus.  

#### 3) Receptor processes:  
* Visual receptors in the back of the eye recieve light, then:  
	1. the receptors transform environmental energy into electrical
	   energy, then  
	2. they shape perception by the way they respong to stimuli. 
* **visual pigment** - light-sensitive chemical in visual receptors that
  allows them to transform light energy into electrial energy.  
* **transduction** - formation between two forms of energy.  
* **transduction by the visual pigments** - allows information about the
  representation of the tree formed on the retina to reach the brain and
  perception occurs.  
* **visual pigment** - shapes perception:
	1. the ability to see dim light depends on having a high
	   concentration of pigment in the receptors.   
	2. because there are different types of pigments. 

#### 4) Neural procressing:  
* Transduced neurobiological signals are processed and transmitted to *primary sensory cortices*
in the brain, where the signals are processed further. 

#### 5) Perception:  
* *perception* - conscious awareness of the tree  
	* **visial form agnosia** - an inability to recognize objects 

#### 6) Recognition:    
* *recognition* - placing an object in a category  
 
#### 7) Action:    
* previous **knowledge** or experiences affects many levels of the perceptual process.  
* **top-down processing** biases your perceptions, leading you towards ***certain** conclusions/actions.  
* **bottom-up processing** is driving more by the properties of the stimulus.  

Measurement
------------
* **qualia**:
	- Experiences in the head.  
	- Scientists can't directly observe  
* **theoretical constructs**:  
	- unobservable entities  
	- Scientists believe they exists, but can't be observed directly.  
  
* **opertional definition** - assigns observable behavior as a proxy for the unobservable mental entity and allows you to infer its presence.  

#### Measuring perception  

** David Marr's levels of analysis:  
1. Computational Level (most abstract)  - ** what and why solve the problem? **  
	* we don't know anything about the attended stimulus.  
2. Algorithmic Level - ** how does it solve it? what representation does it use? **   
3. Implementation Level (most concrete) - ** instantiation in the brain or system? **  


If you really think about it:
------------------------------
What happens if there's no transduction by the visual pigments? (pg. 7) 


On the study guide:  
--------------------  
* Be able to explain how perception is an **active process**. How is it different than a passive view?  
	* Perception requires *knowledge*, *enviornmental context*, and *dynamic interaction*.  
	* We are constantly re-orienting to the environment.  

iClicker Questions: 
-------------------
1. Human sensory systems can be best thought of as:  
	a. automatic in nature.  
	b. decoupled from the external environment.  
	c. passively receiving sensory stimuli.  
	d. **actively engaging sensory stimuli.**
