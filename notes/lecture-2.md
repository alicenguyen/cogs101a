Lecture 2 - Levels of Analysis and Explanation
================================================
The study and measurement of perception:    
-----------------------------------------
	1. The perceptual process  
	2. Defining measurement of perception  
	3. Parsing perception:
		- the **empirical** (reductionist) approach and Marr's levels of analysis  
	4. Qualitative approaces to measurement:  
		- Description and recognition  
	5. Quantitative approaches to measurement:  
		- Detection and magnitude estimation  
	
#### 1) Perception as an active process:  
Environmental stimulus  
* light hits the tree and is then reflected from the tree to the
  person's eyes.  
* sensory apparatus orients towards a **distal stimulus** in the environment  
* the tree is the distal stimulus.  
		  
#### 2) Light is reflected and transformed:  
* light reaches the eye and is transformed as it is focused by the eye's
  optical system --> ** cornea **  
* The sensory signal from the **distal stimulus** is transmitted and transformed to become a pattern 
* the **proximal stimulus** - on the sensory organ.  
* ***stimuli and responses created by stimuli are transformed, or
  changed, between the environment stimulus and perception***  
* form a sharp image of the tree on the ***receptors*** of the person's
  retina.    
* ***Principle of representation*** - "everything a person percieves is
  based not on direct contact with stimuli but on represesntation of
  stimuli that are fomed on the recepters and on activity in the
  person's nervous system.  
* the light reflected from the tree is the proximal stimulus.  

#### 3)Receptor processes:  
* Visual receptors in the back of the eye recieve light, then:  
	1. the receptors transform environmental energy into electrical
	   energy, then  
	2. they shape perception by the way they respong to stimuli. 
* *visual pigment* - light-sensitive chemical in visual receptors that
  allows them to transform light energy into electrial energy.  
* *transduction* - formation between two forms of energy.  
* *transduction by the visual pigments* - allows information about the
  representation of the tree formed on the retina to reach the brain and
  perception occurs.  
* *visual pigment* - shapes perception:
	1. the ability to see dim light depends on having a high
	   concentration of pigment in the receptors.   
	2. because there are different types of pigments. 
#### 4) Neural procressing:  
#### 5) Perception:  
#### 6) Recognition:    
#### 7) Action:

What happens if there's no transduction by the visual pigments? (pg. 7)
