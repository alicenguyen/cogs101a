Q1. In the perceptual process, ______ is the transformation of one form of energy to another
1. Neural processing
2. Transmission
3. Stimulation
3. *Transduction*
5. Sensory exchange

Q2. The clinical disorder of visiual form agnosia was provided as an example of how we might
fail to ______ an object, even though we detect the features of the object.
1. *recognize*
2. perceive
3. transmit
4. attend to
5. act on

Q3. In a perception experiment, you would like to measure the experience of the subject in 
response to some stimulus being pressent. Since their experience is not directly observable, the
experimenter must create ____ which gives us something that can be directed observed.
1. *opeartional definitions* - for the internal theoretical construct. This assigns observable
behavior as a proxy for the unobservable mental entity and allows you to infer its presence
2. theoretical constructs  - unobservable entities (e.g. color perception) - exist in some sense,
but can't be observed directly.
3. qualia - experiments in the head of the subject. Can't observe. 
4. algorithms

Q4. According to Marr's levels of analysis, the ____ level is the most abstract and ties to 
characterize the nature of the problem solved by the system
1. descriptive
2. *computational*
3. implementation
4. algorithmic

Q5. You design a study that examines color vision by recording the ouputs of specific recepter 
(cones and rods) in response to the presentation of particular samples of colored lights. You
conclude that particular colored lights cause specific patterns of responses in the cone
receptors. What is the deepest of Marr's level of analysis that fits this explanation?
1. Computational
2. Experimental
3. Algorithmic
4. Physiological
5. *Implementation*

Q6. You perform an auditory experiment in the Psychology department. The experimenter asks you
to press button "A" when two tones presented have unequal loudness. Otherwise, you are supposed 
to press "B" if they seem to have equal loudness. You notice that some pairs of tones are harder
to judge than others. What is being measured in this experiment?
1. absolute threshold
2. *difference threshold*
3. magnitude estimation
4. auditory recognition

Q7. Which of the quantitative methods listed below is most accurate when attempting to find the
absolute threshold for detecting a stimulus?
1. *method of constant stimuli*
2. method of adjustment
3. method of limits
4. method of comparison

Q8. When determining the difference threshold for a given sensory dimension, Weber's law suggest
that as the value of the standard increases, the value of DL will
1. stay constant
2. *increase*
3. decrease
4. weber's law doesn't address this

Q9. Response ___ in a magnitude estimation experiemnt occurs when doubling the stimulus intensity
LESS than doubles the subjective magnitude of the stimulus
1. inhibition
2. **compression**
3. *expansion* (WRONG - See lecture 3, slides 35-37, for more info)
4. excitation
5. calibration 

Q10. Psychophysics attempts to identify regularities between the physical properties of stimuli
and the psychological states the induce in observers. When a lawful relationship between 
stimuli and sensations is defined (e.g. Steven's Power Low), this seems to best fit which
of Marr's levels of analysis?
1. computational
2. **algorithmicic**
3. *implementation* (WRONG - While this includes inputs and outputs, the psychophysical law
attempts to construct a model of what is happening such that the output can always be predicted
based on the input) 
4. all levels equallly.
