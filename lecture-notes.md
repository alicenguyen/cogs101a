##### Perception as an active process
--------------------------------
* continuous, dynamic. 
* each engagement with the sensory environment involves many iterations of the process

...1. environmental stimulus
......* _distal stimulus_: we orient our sensory apparatus 
		towards the distal stimulus in the environment.

	2. Light reflected and transformed
		* _proximal stimulus_: the sensory signal from the distal stimulus is transmitted and
		transformed to become a pattern - the proximal stimulus - on the sensory organ. 
		* "the thing that already hitting my eye"
		* distal stimulus doesn't change
		* distal and proximal will always be different

	3. Receptor processes
		* the energy of the stimulus (light, air pressure, motion, etc) is
		transduced into the electrical energy used by the nervous system.

	4. Neural Processing
		* _primary sensory cortices_: these new neurobiological signals are processed and 
		transmitted to primary sensory cortices in the brain, where the signals are processed 
		further

	5. Preception 
		* _consciously percieve_ or detect the stimulus
	
	6. Recognition

	7. Action

* Perception vs. Recognition
	* _visual form agnosia_ - an extreme case where common objects cannot be recognized.
	* detect -> recognize (i.e. seeing then recognizing your dentist at the rock concert)
	* _recognize -> detect_  -----> blind sight, 

* Previous _knowledge_ (experiences) affects perceptual process
	* _top-down processing_ - biases your percetion, leading you toward certain conclusions/actions
	* _bottom up processing_ - driven more by the properties of the stimulus.

###### Measuring perception
-----------------------------
Steps:
.... 1. define terms
.... 2. develop a framework for empirically examining and testing specific sensory systems.
.... 3. ensure that the framework can examine many different conceptual levels of activity.

_Measurement_ is assigning numbers (or categories) to observable events.
.... * _qualia_ - experiences in the head of the subject are called sensory qualia. Scientists can't directly observe these.
.... * we need to create
		
###### David Marr's levels of analysis
.... 1. computational level (most abstract)
....... - what problems does the system solve (and why)?
....... - what does vision do for us?
.... 2. Algorithmic Level
....... - How does it solve these problems? What representations does it use?
.... 3. Implementation Level (most concrete)
...... - How is this instancitated in the brain or system?

h3. Basic function

The human eye is sensitive to a narrow electromagnetic specturm (range from 400-700 nanometers).  

Anything below below 300 nanometers can kill biological tissues.  
  
h3. How does light get to the recepters in the eye?

cornea (_liquid_ aqueous humor ( pupil ( lens ( vitreous humor ( retina:

* cornea does most of the focusing
* inverted retina - to be maximally sensitive to face the other direction.
* the path that light has to go through.  
	   
iris & pupil size:
* the iris can either constrict or expand to regulate light input to the eye
* this automatic response environmental light intensity
* constriction in one eye, in response to light, causes the other pupil to constrict, even without direct light (**pupiliary light reflex**).  
* Less light (and staets of emotional arousal) also dilate the pupil, making it larger.  
	* excitement
	* emotional arousal
	* drugs
	* physically excitement  

focusing light:
* the **cornea** is a transparent structure that provides about 70%-80% of the eye's focal power.
* the **lens** is flexible and its curature (thickness) can be adjusted to focus light on the
retuna.  This is called **accommodation** and accounts for 20% of focusing power.
* the closest point at which..
* the goal is to focus light on the bacl of the retina.
* a flattened lens (**ciliary muscle** *relaxed*) will bend the incoming light less, resulting in a more distant focal point.
* a fatter, more convex lens (ciliary muscle constrictred) will bend the light more. This brings
the focal length closer to the lens. 
* Accommodations is just the process of changing the lens shape in the eye.  

Age related changes in the lens:
* as you get older the way the actual fibers in the lens breakdown, the lens become harder and less flexible.
* the muscles begin to weaken -> make it more convex or and make it more flat. the ciliary muscules controllting the lens weaken.
* the distance of the near ppint will then increase. This is called **presbyopia** ("old eye").
* also a greater chances of cataracts from breaking down of the lens - clouding of the lens -
as you get older.

Detail vision:
* to get detail, you want to focus that light on that particular detail on the back of that retina. 
* incoming light is focused on the **macula**, a cone rich area that allows high-resolution vision. It has a yellow pigment that absorbs blue and ultraviolet light.  
* The **fovea** is in the center of the macula. It has the densest concentration of cones that provides find detail vision. *fovea only has cones**
* largely free of ganglion cells and capillaries, allowing more light through.

Myopia (a condition):
* difficulty to see things at a distance
* the images far away will be focused before they hit the retina. IOW, distant imgages are focused in front of the retina
* there are two types:
	1. *refractive' myopia - the cornea of lens converges (focuses) light too much.
	2. * axial myopia* - the yey is too long
* the treatments are to use a corrective lens or to reshape (flatten) the cornea. 

Hyperopia (a condition):
* images are focused *beyond* the retina
* an inabillity to clearly see close objects
* before can be caused by ..
* ..

Vitreous humor:
* after passing through the lens, light must travel through the **vitreous humor**, a gelatinous
substance that helps maintain the shape of the eye.
* keeps the shape of the eye rounded.
* born and die with the same vitreous humor
* **Floaters** can sometimes be seen in the vitreous as debris (blood cells, clotted vitreous, etc.) casts a shadow on the retina.
* Most people experience floaters, though an abrupt increase can signal a detached retina, retina; tear , or other injury. A small tear in the retina will let red blood cells in.

h4. Process check
If your cornea refracts (bends) light too much, you are most likely to have which of the following vision problems?
b. myopia!!

h3. Design considerations  

Since you know that detai vision nvolves focusing light and images onto the fovea, how does this affet the design of cognitive artifacts?  

How can developmental differences affect how you design visual images for specific groups?

For young users:
* make visual images colorful, but simple.
text can be very small even to exclude older users.
* pokeman cards
